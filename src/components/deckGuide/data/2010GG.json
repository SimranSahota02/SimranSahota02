    "paragraph": "This archetype was a powerhouse early in the Diamond & Pearl era, and with the return of Double Colorless Energy HS in HGSS it made a triumphant return in time for 2010 worlds! Placing second in masters & with 3 total in top 16, this deck is a top-tier threat. Combining the disruptive power of Psychic Lock, the decks namesake, and the consistency boost of its Telepass PokePower, Gardevoir SW is a powerhouse card. Its split evolution Gallade SW gives the deck a single-use nuke of up to a staggering 200 damage! But the bag of tricks doesn’t stop there as, Nidoqueen RR, Dusknoir DP, Azelf LVX & Gardevoir LVX all build on the gameplan of heavy disruption & building an overwhelming board. Set up with Spiritomb AR , take surprise prizes with Gardevoir LVX ‘s Bring Down and lock your opponent out of the game with a well-timed Judge UL + Psychic Lock combo!"
