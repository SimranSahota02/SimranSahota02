Traditionally it has been used to load Energy to Rocket\u2019s Sneasel ex, but at times going aggressive with Sneasel leaves your board open and underdeveloped as you go ahead on prizes early. Thankfully, the engine already has a built in fix for this problem: Dark Dragonair. Dark Dragonair\u2019s Evolutionary Light Poke-Power can set up your board quickly and consistently, but it has to be in the active spot which clashes too much with Rocket\u2019s Sneasel ex\u2019s game plan of attacking turn one."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I turned to Ben of PTCGArchive with these thoughts and he suggested I take a look at the other variants of the deck, including a Japanese list which played no Sneasel and instead played Sceptile ex \u03b4.
